# Email-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

## Business Objectives & User Stories

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of email marketing campaigns for a local business. The goal was to develop a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to help the marketing team and executives monitor campaign effectiveness and user engagement, identify improvement opportunities, and optimize future marketing strategies. Below are the business objectives and user stories that guided the design and development of the dashboard.

### Business Objectives:
1. **Improve Campaign Performance Monitoring**  
   The marketing team needed a tool to track the delivery, open, and click-through rates (CTR) of email campaigns over time, as well as user engagement metrics. By understanding trends in these metrics, they aim to improve the effectiveness of future campaigns.
   
2. **Identify Key Customer Segments**  
   The business wanted to identify which customer segments were the most responsive to email campaigns. This would enable more personalized marketing strategies for different customer groups and lead to increased engagement.
   
3. **Reduce Subscription Cancellations**  
   A focus was placed on understanding why users unsubscribe from marketing emails. This would help the marketing team implement retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

4. **Evaluate Campaign Success against Business KPIs**  
   The sales and marketing managers needed to compare the performance of different email campaigns against predefined key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, unsubscribe rates, and customer retention.
